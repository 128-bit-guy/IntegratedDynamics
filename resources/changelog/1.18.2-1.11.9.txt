As always, don't forget to backup your world before updating!
Requires CyclopsCore version 1.16.0 or higher.

Changes:
* Rename 'Crystalized' to 'Crystallized', Closes #1206

Fixes:
* Fix NBT reading of empty itemstacks
  This fixes read NBT data not updating after non-player item move.
  When things like hoppers drain items from inventories,
  the stack size is set to zero, but the NBT tag is still
  present on that item.
  Because of that, we should only allow NBT reading of non-empty items
  Closes #1208
